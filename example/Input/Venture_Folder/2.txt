MM is an AgTech venture from Minneapolis founded in 2023 by a biochemist, fungal ecologist, and packaging engineer. The startup manufactures compostable packaging materials from mycelium—the root structure of fungi—as a sustainable alternative to styrofoam and plastic. Their product is designed for food producers and e-commerce companies looking to reduce environmental impact. MM received a $500,000 grant from the USDA Innovation Challenge and recently joined the IndieBio accelerator. With three pilot customers already onboard, they are seeking $1.5 million in seed funding to expand their manufacturing capacity and finalize commercial-grade molds.
