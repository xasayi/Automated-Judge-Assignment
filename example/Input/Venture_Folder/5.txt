Carbon is a biotech-meets-materials startup based in London, founded in 2024 by a group of CRISPR researchers and sustainable fashion veterans. The company has developed a microbial ink platform that creates biodegradable pigments through engineered bacteria â€” a clean alternative to petroleum-based dyes. Carbon inks are already in use by two avant-garde fashion houses, and the startup is in talks with a major athletic wear brand. With a $750K grant from the EU Green Horizon Initiative, they are now raising a $2M seed round to scale bioreactors and streamline pigment purification.
