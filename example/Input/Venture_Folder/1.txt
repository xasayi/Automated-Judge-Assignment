Loop is a Denver-based space logistics startup founded in 2024 by a team of MIT aerospace engineers and ex-SpaceX staff. The company is developing a hybrid balloon-rocket system to provide on-demand, micro-payload delivery to low Earth orbit. Their service targets small satellite startups and academic researchers who need affordable, flexible access to space. Backed by $1.2 million in pre-seed funding from Deep Space Angels and Stellar Startups Fund, Loop has already secured six letters of intent and partnerships with two research institutions. They are currently raising a $3 million seed round to build and test their first full-scale prototype.
