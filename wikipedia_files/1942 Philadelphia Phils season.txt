The 1942 Philadelphia Phils season was the 60th season in the history of the franchise. The team, managed by Hans Lobert, began their fifth season at Shibe Park. Prior to the season, the team shortened the team nickname form Phillies to 'Phils'. Of the change, baseball writer George Kirksey opined prior to the season, "the gag is they wanted to get the 'lie' out of their name."
