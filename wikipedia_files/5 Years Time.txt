"5 Years Time" did not chart upon its first release in 2007. After poor initial sales, the group chose to re-release the single, and the record made it onto the charts in a number of countries. In the UK, it debuted at number 24, and went on to become Noah and the Whale's first top-ten single, peaking at number 7. In Ireland, "5 Years Time" debuted at number 47 and peaked at number 10.

Music video
The music video features the band performing in a pub and dancing/playing in the park. During the video, Laura Marling, who provides backing vocals for the group, is seen playing a tin whistle and also giving the camera the two-fingers. The video was directed by James Copeman. The style of the video resembles a Wes Anderson film, using the same font the director uses in his films/music videos.
The music video was uploaded to YouTube on 13 June 2008, and as of October 2022 it has been viewed over 12 million times.
