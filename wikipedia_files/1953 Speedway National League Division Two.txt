The 1953 National League Division Two was the eighth post-war season of the second tier of motorcycle speedway in Great Britain.

Summary
The League was reduced at the start of the season again to 10 teams with Oxford Cheetahs dropping down to the Southern League whilst Ashfield Giants closed and Liverpool Chads folded mid-season.
Cradley Heath disbanded following the withdrawal of the promoter Eli Sumner due to financial issues, with the team moving to join the Wolverhampton Wasps (formerly of the Southern League).
Coventry Bees clinched their first title by a single point.
Wolverhampton rider Mike Rogers died on 6 June 1953, the day after receiving critical injuries at Monmore Green Stadium racing against Liverpool. The 22-year-old lost control of his bike and fell heavily before being transported to the Royal Hospital in Wolverhampton.

Final table
Liverpool Chads withdrew mid-season - record expunged.
