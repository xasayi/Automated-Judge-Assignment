In numerology, 11:11 is considered to be a significant moment in time for an event to occur. It is seen as an example of synchronicity, as well as a favorable sign or a suggestion towards the presence of spiritual influence. It is additionally thought that the repetition of numbers in the sequence adds "intensity" to them and increases the numerological effect. 
Critics highlight the lack of substantial evidence for this assertion, and they gesture towards confirmation bias and post-hoc analysis as a scientific explanation for any claims related to the significance or importance of 11:11 and other such sequences. Through observations made in the study of statistics, specifically chaos theory and the law of truly large numbers, skeptics explain these anecdotal observations as a coincidence and an inevitability, rather than as any particular indication towards significance.

Significance in Christianity
Within Protestant Christianity, particularly in Pentecostal movements, the number 11 or 11:11 has been linked to the concept of transition.

Significance in dates
For various reasons, individuals are known to attribute significance to dates and numbers. One notable example is the significance given to "the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month," which corresponds to 11:00 a.m. (Paris time) on 11 November 1918. It marks the moment when the armistice ending World War I took effect.
On 11 November 2011, also known as "11/11/11", there was an increase in the number of marriages occurring in various regions worldwide, including the United States and across the Asian continent.
In Poland, the date of 11/11 (11 November) and the 11:11 hour are considered symbolic of November 11, 1918, the Polish Independence Day, on which Poland was liberated from German, Austrian and Russian occupation.
