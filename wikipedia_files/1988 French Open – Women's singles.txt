Defending champion Steffi Graf defeated Natasha Zvereva in the final, 6–0, 6–0 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 1988 French Open. It was her second French Open title and third major title overall. Graf did not drop a set during the tournament. The final was the shortest major final of the Open Era; the official duration of the match was 34 minutes, but only 32 minutes of play took place due to a rain break. It remains the only "double bagel" major final of the Open Era.
The win marked Graf's second step towards completing the first, and so far only Golden Slam in the history of tennis. Graf won the title without dropping a set and losing only 20 games during the tournament. Graf recorded a total of six "bagel" (6–0) sets during her seven matches. The final was the first major final since the 1981 French Open not to feature either Martina Navratilova or Chris Evert.
